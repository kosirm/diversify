- **Implementation**: Target start Q2 2025 if approved

## Notes
This idea shows strong potential with a clear market need, good skill alignment, and manageable risk profile. The senior-focused approach differentiates from generic brain training apps, and the family connectivity aspect addresses both cognitive health and social isolation concerns.

The financial projections are conservative but show good potential for a solo developer project. The learning curve for mobile development is the main technical challenge, but Flutter provides a good cross-platform solution.

Recommend proceeding to business analysis phase for detailed financial modeling and implementation planning.
